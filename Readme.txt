Requirements:
In order to run this program all the file names must remain the same because it transitions between
the two jsp in order to auto-populate the selection. The files also must be in the same folder when they are
executed.

How it works:
Basically this program allows a user to first choose a verb and from that verb the user has a list of options
for the noun part will appear that corresponds with the verb they selected. Once the noun is selected it will show results from the query and the condition selection area
will also be populated so the user can select more in detail what condition they want and then that query will
replace the one that showed up earlier.

Step by step:
1) select from the list of verbs
2) query the verb and get the list of nouns
3) put the nouns in the list to allow users to select
4) display results automatically
5) use the verb and noun to query for conditions
6) if conditions are available put them in the list for the users to select
7) if the user chooses an option from condition, we replace the result displayed currently with the new one

How to run:
Run the file named noun test first and the rest will be taken cared of by the program itself.

Extra-Credit
This program is in addition to the one I turned in earlier which does not have these features.
